#CyberSource Simple Order API for Java

##Requirements

1. Java SDK 1.6 and later  
2. Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy files from Oracle® (US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar), available at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html
	
##Prerequisites

######A CyberSource Evaluation account. 

Sign up here:  <http://www.cybersource.com/register>

* Complete your Evaluation account creation by following the instructions in the Registration email

######Transaction Security Keys

* Create security keys in the Enterprise Business Center (ebctest) after you've created your Merchant Admin account. 
Refer to our Developer's Guide for details <http://apps.cybersource.com/library/documentation/dev_guides/security_keys/html/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=securityKeys_SO_API.4.2.html>.

######JCE Unlimited Strength Jars

  Replace your Java installation’s existing security policy files with the new ones you downloaded from the Oracle site:
  
* 	Locate your existing US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar files in the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security directory.  
* 	Rename or move your existing files to another directory.  
* 	Copy the new US_export_policy.jar and local_policy.jar that you downloaded from Oracle to the $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security directory.  

##Installing the SDK 

1. You need a security key (<your merchant id>.p12) in order to send requests
   to the server.  If you do not have your key yet, refer Transaction Security Keys 
   link mentioned above for the procedure to create one.
   
2. Unzip the CyberSource package into a directory of your choice.  It will
   create a directory called cybersource-sdk-java-master. 
 
3. Go to the cybersource-sdk-java-master/sample directory.

4. Edit cybs.properties and make the following changes:
	
	a. Set merchantID, keyAlias and keyPassword to your merchantID.  Please note that it is case-sensitive.
    
    b. Set keysDirectory to the directory where your key resides.  Use forward-slashes for the directory separator, even on Windows.
	   For example, "c:/keys"
	   
	(Optional Additional Changes)
    c. Set targetAPIVersion to the latest version displayed at: https://<cybersource-host>/commerce/1.x/transactionProcessor/
	   By default, it is set to the latest version when the package was created.
	   	
    d. Modify the logging properties as appropriate. Use forward-slashes for the directory separator in the logDirectory value, even on Windows. The directory you specify must already exist.
	   
    e. Please refer to the accompanying documentation for the other optional properties that you may wish to specify.
	   
	NOTE:  sendToProduction is initially set to false.  Set it to true only
	       when you are ready to send live transactions.

##Testing the Client
	a. TESTING THE NAME-VALUE PAIR SAMPLE
			1. Go to the cybersource-sdk-java-master/sample/nvp directory.
			2. At a command prompt, type this line:
			 	Windows 	runSample.bat
				Unix or Linux 	runSample.sh
				
				If JAVA_HOME is defined, the script uses <JAVA_HOME>/bin/java. Otherwise, it uses
				whatever java is in the path.
				If the client is installed correctly, the requests and replies for a credit card authorization
				and a follow-on capture appear.

			3. If you make any changes to the AuthCaptureSample.java sample, you
			   must rebuild the sample before using it. Use the compileSample batch file or
			   shell script provided in the sample directory.
			   
	b. TESTING THE XML SAMPLE
		   	1. Go to the cybersource-sdk-java-master/sample/xml directory.
			2. At a command prompt, type this line:
			 	Windows 	runSample.bat
				Unix or Linux 	runSample.sh
				
				If JAVA_HOME is defined, the script uses <JAVA_HOME>/bin/java. Otherwise, it uses
				whatever java is in the path.
				If the client is installed correctly, the requests and replies for a credit card authorization
				and a follow-on capture appear.

			3. If you make any changes to the AuthSample.java sample, you
			   must rebuild the sample before using it. Use the compileSample batch file or
			   shell script provided in the sample directory.
